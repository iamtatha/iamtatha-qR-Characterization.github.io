		<h1>2D Polar Co-ordinate Plotting and qR Value Characterization</h1>
		<h3>By Centre for Interdisciplinary Research and Education</h3>

		<p>CIRE is a non-profit Organization working in Interdisciplinary Research Projects in the field of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology for many years. Our Recent Accomplishments
		include proposing peptide vaccines for various viral organisms along with characterising nucleotide or protein sequences with mathematical descriptors and graphical representations.
		This 2D Polar plot is one of the fruits of such theoritical approaches. In this method we assign certain angles to each amino acid upon their various biochemical properties and while
		plotting the graph we move through a vector by unit magnitude to the assigned direction. In this way we get a graph and calculating the centre of mass of this graph we get the qR value.
		Our experiments and analysis indicates this qR value to be characteristic property for a sequence.</p>
